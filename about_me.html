            <p class="para">I dont actually know what to write about myself. Unlike Other humans, I eat, sleep, take shit and repeat. Recently, I've struggling with a lot of things. Academic pressure, Coding, balancing sleep and work, keeping a good relationship with close friends. But its been tough man! No one visits the about page so I can write whatever I want I suppose. Huh no one will ever read. or will you?  </p>
